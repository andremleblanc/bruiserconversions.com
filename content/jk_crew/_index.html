      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The JK Crew started as a concept vehicle engineered in the imagination
        and heart of our team. The design is inspired from the desire of the
        Jeep community for a Jeep pickup. What started as dream began
        taking shape on paper and slowly became a truly iconic vehicle capturing
        the spirit of rugged exploration.
      </p>

      <h2>Vehicle Design</h2>
      <p>
        Forged with form and function in mind, the JK Crew performs as
        comfortable off-road as on. A 5'x4'-6"' bed is added to a standard
        four-door Jeep Wrangler for increased carrying capacity. The custom
        fabricated bed design is ready to go anywhere with intentional descent
        angle clearance.
      </p>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        Pricing for the JK Crew conversion starts at $35,000 and is dependent
        on the full build sheet. For more details please contact us.
