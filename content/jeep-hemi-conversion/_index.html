      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Hemi conversion is all about power, performance, and reliability.
        The 500 horsepower / 500 foot pound 6.4L engine will make your Jeep
        drive like a whole new ride. This engine is the same 6.4L Hemi 392 V-8
        engine used in the SRT8 Jeep Cherokee and SRT8 Dodge Challenger. All of
        our engines are brand new, crate engines. If you are looking for speed,
        this is the conversion for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Quality</h2>
      <p>
        Conversions are completed using OEM quality parts. To break it down,
        roughly 90 percent of the components in the conversion are from Mopar.
        The other 10 percent are manufactured by established companies that want
        to bring new life to your old ride. The battery tray/air box, throttle
        body adapters, fan shroud for truck motors, motor mounts and
        transmission mount are all designed using The latest in CAD design
        technology and then constructed from high quality, laser cut steel.
        They are formed on a CNC press brake and expertly assembled by certified
        welders. All wiring harnesses are built by trained professionals and
        computer tested before shipment for functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Superchargers</h2>
      <p>
        Horsepower gains with a supercharger are impressive. We can use
        Magnuson, Kenne Bell and Edelbrock to name a few. Cost for this will
        range from $8500 to $11,500 depending on your application and horsepower
        you are looking for.
