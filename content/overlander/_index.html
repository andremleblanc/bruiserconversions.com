      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Bruiser Overlander is purpose built for the avid off road family.
        Building upon the capabilities of the 4-door Jeep Wrangler, the
        Overlander allows you to carry a crew of six adults to the most remote
        locations they desire to explore, with ample cargo area for gear and
        supplies.
      </p>

      <h2>Vehicle Design</h2>
      <p>
        The Overlander is equipped with a 450 HP Bruiser Conversions LS3,
        Teraflex long arm suspension, and Ultimate Dana 60 axles. It features
        full-size front and rear doors for easy access to the cockpit and cabin.
        The exterior of the body is clad in a complete GenRight Off Road bumper
        and armor package, Warn Zeon 10s winch with Factor 55 UltraHook, with
        TnT Customs aluminum skid plates to protect your vehicle while it's
        being put to the test.
