      <p>
        I have had the pleasure of wheeling with the Bruiser team for many
        years, as well as driving their conversions. The trucks handle great
        both on and off-road and their power is something you just won't find
        anywhere else. People can't help but look, gawk and ask a ton of
        questions because they are so unique in both their looks and
        performance. Plus, the entire team is made up of some of my favorite
        people to be around with due to their positive attitudes and constant
        desire to make everything function at the best of it's potential.

      <p>
        I have known Jeff for 7 years, so when it was time to build my 2014 JKU
        into the LEGEND2.0 with a LS3 480 HP hot cam he was my first call for
        engine swap advice.  Being 10 hours apart, I planned to have the work
        done closer... but when Jeff said they could do an LS swap in a week,
        I had to put it to the test.  Anyone that could swap that fast with
        confidence clearly has their ducks in a row.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure enough, a week later
        I was headed down to pick her up! Jeff walked me through the numerous
        custom machined components proprietary to his conversions; some
        serious hardware! His engineering, his team, and their overall
        commitment to quality all came through.  Doing burnouts as soon as I
        got back to Charlotte!  Thanks Jeff!

      <h2>Brandon Edgerton</h2>
      <p>
        Like many jeep owners I set out to build the ultimate go anywhere jeep
        to provide amazing family wheeling excursions. Initially built was a
        mild mod JKU, however the anemic 3.6L became the 'weak link' so I sough
        out an engine conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        After determining the LS3 as the most optimum power plant, I then began
        to search for a builder/installer and chose a local SEMA Jeep Builder.
        As I explained to the selected builder, 'there are 2 ways to do things,
        the right way and the wrong' no in-between. Unfortunately for me that
        selected builder had very little integrity and built a very expensive
        paperweight.
      </p>
      <p>
        After those in the Jeep community found out what happened many stepped
        in to assist with my build. We began an extensive rebuild, and we chose
        the industry leader in LS3 Conversions, Bruiser Conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeff personally walked me through their process; and I met with his team
        to review my project in entirety. All my concerns were eased and I was
        thankful to have selected a 'builder crew' who's only objective was to
        deliver a perfect conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bruiser team reworked my entire drive train, wiring, cooling &amp; much
        more. The Bruiser crew rebuilt my jeep the 'right way'!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        My family set out on our first maiden journey with 'Redemption' at
        All4Fun in Colorado. The jeep performed exceedingly well and left many
        on the trail wishing they had an LS3 under their hood. We've since gone
        on several family wheeling adventures and the time spent on the trail,
        as a family, is priceless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driving this beast around town and on road trips brings a smile to all
        as the engine rpms are met with a V8 rumble. This once anemic jeep is
        powerful, smooth, and functions as if it came from the dealer with an LS3.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are often met at the gas stations with persons asking to see what the
        'heck' is under the hood. People are amazed at the 'fit &amp; finish' which
        is absolutely a 'work of art'! I've seen several HEMI &amp; LS conversions
        and Bruisers craftsmanship is second to none.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you Bruiser Conversions &amp; Jeff for delivering the ultimate go
        anywhere jeep my family was dreaming about.

      <h6>Dixie 4 Wheel Drive - Owner</h6>

      <p>
        In the last 10 months Dixie 4 Wheel Drive has installed 6 Bruiser
        Conversions LS3 “Do It Yourself Kit” motor conversions. At first we
        didn't know much about Bruiser Conversions since we are from Utah and
        they're from Florida. I had heard a few good things about Bruisers, but
        usually East coast service is hard to keep in touch with. However, with
        Bruisers it was different.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a shop stand point, we were excited to hear that their motor
        conversion kit was one of the best JK V8's kits on the market. Since we
        had done several different Hemi and LS conversions before, we were
        anxious to install the “Do It Yourself Kit” into our 2015 SEMA build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the motor conversion showed up, we were super excited to open the
        crate up and see the install kit. The wiring harness and front accessory
        drive kit were complete and ready to go on the Jeep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we were one
        of the first shops to install the kit there were no instructions.
        However, after a few brief phone calls, Bruiser's tech support had us
        going in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technicians are super impressed with the “Do It Yourself Kit”. It's
        complete and well thought out! We are excited to have a LS3 conversion
        kit that is clean, easy to install, and our customers love that all of
        their factory option upgrades, like cruise and remote control start,
        still work.
      </p>
      <p>
        With 6 conversion kit installs under our belt, including my own daily
        driver, we know there will be a lot more LS3 builds to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best of
        all, the guys at Bruisers have treated us good. Not only are they good
        with follow up phone calls, they also go out of their way to say hi to
        us at off-road events like King Of the Hammer's and Sema. We look
        forward to future projects between Dixie 4 Wheel Drive and
        Bruiser Conversions.

      <h2>Tom Allen</h2>
      <h6>PSC Motorsports - CEO</h6>

      <p>
        To make it short and sweet, Jeff and his crew over at Bruiser
        Conversions hit a homerun with their LS conversion for the Jeep JK! I
        personally believe it is by far the best LS conversion on the market.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we here at PSC Motorsports decided to do a V8 swap in one of our
        new 2015 JK's, I knew I wanted a LS3. We have done the Hemi thing in the
        past and this time I had my heart set on a LS3. So when it came time to
        pull the trigger on the project we hooked up with Jeff Garland and
        Bruiser Conversions.
      </p>

      <p>
        He has come up with a very different approach to the JK / LS swap, and
        it is ingenuous. Fellow off road industry insiders had been telling me
        how well the Bruiser Conversion works and well, I am a believer! I
        freaking love this Jeep and it's all due to the flawless LS3 conversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The craftsmanship of the conversion is over the top. We have been from
        one end of the country to the other in this Jeep over the last 6 months,
        pounded on it off road, drove 100's of miles at highway speeds,
        108 degree days in Dallas TX traffic and never a problem what so ever.
        My wife actually prefers to drive this Jeep over her new Cadillac!
      </p>

      <p>
        If anyone has any doubts about this quality of this conversion, make
        your way over to Fort Worth, Texas and look us up. Got no problem with
        putting you in the driver's seat and let you judge for yourself what
        a quality piece of work this conversion is!

      <h6>Spider Web Shade - COO</h6>

      <p>
        As a manufacturer of Jeep parts, our company Jeeps are our sales tools.
        We are very careful when choosing the modifications we make because our
        vehicle's performance is a direct reflection of our company when on the
        trail. It is of paramount importance that our vehicles are on the
        cutting edge and mechanical failures are kept to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when the time came to upgrade the power plant in one of our 2014 JK
        with a reliable and powerful LS motor there was only one company in the
        United States to call, Bruiser Conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Jeff and his team were able to do in 6 days is mind blowing and the
        finished product is FACTORY perfect.  Every nut and bolt checked and not
        a single issue.  We would recommend Bruiser and Jeff's entire team to
        anyone in the market who demands excellence in performance and customer
        service.

      <p>
        Savvy Off Road is know for their winning KOH Jeeps and lightweight
        armor.  When we chose to install a LS3 in our 2014 JK Unlimited, there
        was only one choice. Bruiser Conversions!
      </p>
      <p>
        The LS3 conversion for the JKU is the best available kit. No double
        computer or harness to take up space and maintain. We have seen our fair
        share of double harness kits leave the owners very frustrated.
        The batteries would go dead on them frequently and not all of the
        features of the JK were available like OEM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bruiser Conversion on the other hand uses the OEM Jeep computer and
        transmission so everything functions like it is from the factory except
        you now have 430+ HP.
      </p>
      <p>
        We install the best of the best in everything we do.
        Bruiser Conversions is the only way to go!

      <p>
        I've been a Jeep enthusiast most of my life, so when it came to building
        my "forever" Jeep I knew that finding the right builder was everything.
        From my very first interaction with Bruiser I felt like much more than a
        client. I immediately felt like I had a friend in the industry who was
        helping me fulfill my vision to create a fully customized, one off,
        SEMA worthy rig.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a family of 6 a stock JKU just doesn't get it done, especially
        when it comes to camping off grid and exploring remote areas as my
        family and I often do. Bruiser worked with me every step of the build
        from concept to completion. They steered me away from pitfalls and
        educated me on innovative ways to achieve what ended up being one of the
        most amazing builds I have ever been fortunate enough to stand beside,
        and I get to call it mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner of Bruiser, Jeff Garland, is one of the most genuine and
        creative men I have ever met. His attention to detail, commitment to
        integrity and dedication to greatness was evident within everyone on
        his team at Bruiser Conversions. He showed me from the very beginning
        that Bruiser is much more than an amazing innovator in the Jeep
        industry, they honestly care about their clients and do
        "whatever it takes" (one of Jeff's most often used quotes lol) to
        fulfill their dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Jeff Garland and Dave his shop manager, to everyone that works for
        Bruiser, I feel blessed to have met this amazing team and could not be
        any happier with our new 3 row, 6 seat, off grid, high horsepower,
        luxury, camping race machine. I know I have found some friends for life
        and that they will forever have my back to do "whatever it takes".

        I want to extend a very heartfelt thank you on behalf of myself, my wife
        and 4 children to Bruiser for helping my dream become a reality.
        My family and I are forever grateful.

      <p>
        Being in the off-road industry myself, I am very picky about where my
        Jeep is worked on. Add to that the major work of an engine swap and you
        quickly realize that trust in the shop is EVERYTHING! Jeff and the crew
        are at the top of their game! The attention to detail is unmatched and
        the quality could not be any better. Simply put... they know what they
        are doing. Add to that the friendly service and you have a winning
        combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks again guys!

      <h2>Remko Boot</h2>
      <p>
        No Jeep is the same and everybody likes to customize his or hers own.
        As so did I. I started with a used black stock Rubicon unlimited out of
        2012. The reason for this was the new transmission that they introduced
        that year.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the first upgrades (bumpers, lift and tire's) it was time for the
        more serious upgrade, an engine swap. When you are pulling a wrangler
        over the mountains in Colorado with a stock 3.6L V6 engine, you get the
        feeling you are Fred Flintstone. The nice 2.8L CRD would be a nice help
        with that, but unfortunately you can only get those in Europe.
      </p>

      <p>
        What to do? We all love the big V8's. So the next trip would be to your
        local Jeep off-road shop and swap that stock engine for a nice 5.7 or
        6.4 Hemi. Now just wait there for a moment. Let's browse the internet for
        a moment and let's see what is there more on the market.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is where I found Bruiser Conversions, with more options than only
        two Hemi engines. With those options I ran in the problem what to
        choose. Am I staying with the Hemi, a proven concept, or do I choose a
        LS or Diesel engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Time to send the guys at Bruiser a email and ask for some help. Within a
        day I get a email back from Jeff Bruiser if I have time for him that he
        can call me. He writes that for choosing the right engine he needs 45
        minutes of my time to explain the differences between the options. So
        after our phone call, where 45 min became more then one hour, with tons
        of advice about which engine and other parts. I decided to go for the
        LS3 stage 2 swap
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it came to when and where to do the swap. Florida is a long way from
        Colorado to do a swap. Jeff had the solution for that. Trailsjeep in
        Golden Colorado was one of the new locations that where doing swaps for
        him. Because is was one of there first swaps he (Jeff) would even fly
        out to Colorado to oversee my engine swap. So it was al set Trailjeeps
        would do the swap and Jeff would come over to Colorado for a beer and
        check out my Jeep.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was great to meet Jeff during the swap and he could even explain me
        more about the engine and how it al works with the fabric computer that
        is installed in the Jeep. Yes all your functions keep working as they
        always did, even after the swap.
      </p>

      <p>
        So after the swap it was time to start this V8. And what a experience I
        can tell you. The time that I had to pull this wrangler over the
        mountains was over. Colorado here we come!
      </p>

      <p>Since that moment I'm driving my Jeep with a big smile on my face.</p>

      <p>
        I have to thank Jeff, the guys and Bruiser conversations and the guys
        and Trailjeeps for there time and effort to give me a great Jeep, which
        I enjoy every day on and off the road.

      <p>
        I've got a 430hp LS3 installed in my 2012 JK and I love it! I'm running
        37's on one ton axles and the factory V6 was not enough to move the
        thing down the road. I found myself not wanting to drive my Jeep
        anymore... Until I found Bruiser Conversions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their LS3 conversion woke the Jeep up and turned it into a monster!!!
        I daily drive my Jeep now because I enjoy driving it so much. It sounds
        and feels amazing. The most fun part is red light racing little sports
        cars and seeing the look on their faces when you blow the doors off them
        in a lifted Jeep.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most amazing part of the conversion, however, is
        how it just works. All functions work as they did from the factory,
        there aren't any funny warning lights or messages on the dashboard. The
        A/C blows cold. The factory tap shift works. Nothing would make you
        think that it isn't a bone stock Jeep until you hear that exhaust, then
        you know you are driving something special.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to take my Jeep to
        shows as well and when you open up the hood, it's not a rats nest, it's
        a clean swap that looks factory. It's easy to tell the engineering and
        time it took to make the swap look as clean as it does especially with
        how well it works.
      </p>

      <p>Thank you Bruiser Conversions!</p>

      <p>
        My name is Tygh Brogdon, I called Bruiser Conversions to make me a
        custom built “one of a kind” Jeep JK Crew. I am a picky person and
        wanted everything perfect, from the factory rake, to the axles, to the
        wheels, to the tires, to the interior, to the overall height… You see
        how picky I am? I had an entire checklist of items that I wanted
        accomplished.
        </p>
      <p>
        Jeff invited me down and assured me that he could and
        would do his best to achieve everything I was looking for. I showed up
        at his shop with a brand new 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, it had 1,100
        miles on it. He was a bit surprised at some of my requests but low and
        behold HE DELIVERED!!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was communicating with him once or twice a week
        until the project was complete and then more often as the delivery date
        neared. He delivered to my door an absolute beast. We have nicknamed it
        the Sand Trooper, because it is worthy of a Star Wars movie. The paint,
        the rake, the axles, the height, the motor, the tires, the drivability,
        the bulletproofness!!! It is all there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you Jeff &amp; Bruiser Conversions!

      <p>
        January 3, 2015 I had a LS3-430HP Corvette motor installed in my Jeep by
        Bruiser Conversions. Many have asked how I like it, how long did it
        take, what's it like, how was fit and finish, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturday January 3rd I drove from Naples to Clearwater. Met Jeff at
        Jeff's Jeep Yard/Bruiser
        Conversions where I was given a complete tour and filled with a ton of
        knowledge. Jeff will blow your mind with his passion and expertise! Left
        the Jeep in Bruiser's hands and returned to pick it up on
        Friday Jan. 9th. Yes, that is correct - One week for the conversion.
        And not just the conversion, they painted my rear wheel wells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, I was like a kid in a candy store ready for the first
        drive! I'm pretty particular about cleanliness and was pleasantly surprised to
        see how clean the jeep was when I arrived. Once in the driver's seat and
        a turn of the key, I was blown away. The sweet sound of the Magnaflow
        was amazing. All factory options were 100% completely functional as if
        you just purchased vehicle from the dealership. Nothing changed except
        for some serious horsepower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruiser was able to retain the transmission
        in the Jeep based on its capabilities. The WA580, Nag1. When you want
        some torque - hang on!!! It has been approximately 2 months since I
        picked the jeep up and I am still completely amazed at what this
        conversion did. The power, the maneuverability, and the fit and finish
        are truly amazing. I have received follow up calls from Jeff in regards
        to how the Jeep is performing, how I like it, etc. Customer service is
        key and Bruiser definitely has that!
      </p>
      <p>
        All of us Jeep lovers sink a lot of money into our rigs to make them
        Rock Ready, Show Quality, and Daily Drivers. The one thing Jeep is
        lacking on is POWER. Investing the money in doing this LS3 conversion
        has made all the difference in the world.
        My Jeep is my daily driver and every time I get in the driver's seat,
        it's like riding in a corvette, but more comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I truly cannot say enough about how happy I am with how it all came out.
        If you are in the South Florida area and ever want to see it or go for
        a ride, I am always willing to show off the exceptional work these guys
        at Bruiser did!
      </p>
      <p>Keep your eyes open, big things in the works for Bruiser!!</p>

      <h2>Mitch Funk</h2>
      <p>
        I met Jeff Garland at Easter Jeep Safari in 2015. I had an LS conversion
        done on my 2012 JKU by another company with a laundry list of issues,
        and was looking at one of Bruiser Conversions swaps. Jeff leaned in and
        began to tell me how wonderful the LS swap was. I was less than
        responsive as he explained how wonderful his swap was.
      </p>

      <p>
        I explained that I already had the swap done by another company, and was
        less than impressed. Much to my surprise Jeff described several of my
        issues to a "T" without me telling him anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we visited Jeff told me how bad he felt about my experience, and how
        he could correct the issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        I swallowed hard, and put my trust in one more individual who said that
        they could make it work. Jeff arraigned shipping, which is no easy task
        from where I lived, and the JK was on its way to Florida.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Jeep was finished in the prescribed time, for less than I was
        initially quoted, and shipped back to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Jeep was finally everything that I wanted. Jeff, and the guys at
        Bruiser Conversions did a fantastic job. There has only been one minor
        issue since ( a switch on the shift talks of the transfer case ) that
        cause the Jeep to go into limp mode. The guys at Bruiser were quick to
        diagnose the problem, and help me repair it.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience with Bruiser hasn't been anything less than fantastic, and
        I would recommend them to any who ask.
