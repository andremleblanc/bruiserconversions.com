# Overview
This project is built with the static site engine Hugo (https://gohugo.io/). 
Using Hugo allows us to have templates/partials for commons parts of the website, like the navigation,
that are written in one file and included across the site - making maintence far easier than a purely
static site. It also can make blogging/galleries easier through the template/content system.
